# iProtector v4.0.1

## About
**iProtector** is the original plugin that allows you to protect areas with different settings in each one. This *fork*, implementing support for the new *PocketMine-MP API 3.0.0*, provides new features to fully enjoy the artwork created by [*LDX-MCPE*](https://github.com/LDX-MCPE).

This plugin will continue receiving updates and be open to *suggestions* from the public.

## What's new
- You can enable and disable the plugin from the *config*.
- You can choose whether enable or disable the area pretty saving feature.
- You can use a new flag! **TNT**. Protects against TNT and Creeper explosions?
- You can use a new command! **/area here**. It allows you to see what area you are standing on.
- You can set custom messages for **each** event, and also disable the ones you want; place; break; touch and hurt.
